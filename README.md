# EXP10

The EXP 10 is a product showcase of a conceptual car by Bentley Motors. Showing aspects of the car and enticing users to possibly purchase the vehicle.


## Development
For second time coding, this was a diffcult project. I was able to layout and position accordingly, however my difficulties were with mobile and scrolling. I made the site have a full screen scroll via javascript, but it was easier said than done. In my commits, there are many called "...", simply because I had been constantly testing the site on mobile devices. I would use Safari/Chrome inspector, and site seemed to work. Though the moment I used the site on an actual device, scrolling would not work on mobile Safari or Iphone. I kept trying new methods, and had a large amount of frustation. Eventually, I was able to get the scrolling to work, through trial and error.  Along the way I began to understand browser limitations, mobile limitations, and reponsiveness.


## Built With
Bootstrap V3.3.7 (Framework)

Skrollr (Javascript - Full Screen Effect)

Nicescroll (Javascript - Changed Scrolling Speed)
